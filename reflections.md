# ðŸ’¡ Reflections on Module 1

- I now understand what a data engineer actually does.
- I used to think data engineers just manage databases, but they actually build the entire pipelineâ€”from raw data to ready-for-analysis.
- Iâ€™m excited to learn more about ETL, SQL, and tools like Apache Spark.
- I will keep updating this repo after each module so I never forget what Iâ€™ve learned.
